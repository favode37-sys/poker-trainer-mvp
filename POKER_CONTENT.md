# 🃏 Poker Content Strategy - 15 Real Scenarios

## ✅ Implementation Complete

We've created **15 educational poker scenarios** based on **Exploitative Strategy** for **Low Stakes** play. All scenarios follow strict strategic guidelines proven to work at micro and small stakes games.

---

## 📚 Strategic Foundation

### Core Principles (MDA Strategy):

1. **River Raises = Always the Nuts**
   - At low stakes, river raises are NEVER bluffs
   - Correct action: Fold even with strong hands (Top Pair, Overpairs)
   - Population tendency: Massive under-bluffing on rivers

2. **Value Betting**
   - Players call too much at low stakes
   - Correct action: Bet BIG with strong hands (2/3 to 3/4 pot)
   - Don't slowplay - they'll pay you off anyway

3. **Tight is Right Preflop**
   - Fold weak off-suit hands from early position
   - Examples: KJo, AJo, QTo from UTG
   - Premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AKs) get raised
